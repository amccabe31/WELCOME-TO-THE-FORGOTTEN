# WELCOME-TO-THE-FORGOTTEN
Andrew McCabe - 33732385 - The performance patch created as part of my final EMCT project

Welcome to my performance patch, created with smaller artists in mind, for them to have an easier time in setting up and operating performances through an inexpensive, easy-to-use software that does it all!

In order for the patch to work for you as a different artist, you must first understand the concept of the software:
  - currrently, the software - once downloaded - will take you into a smaller version of my original setlist that I performed and tested this patch with. This setlist is a template / example of how you can use the patch for your own use case.
  - The patch itself is designed for you to load your backing tracks and visual elements into each section of the patch, to be triggered and modified by the patch as you perform.
  - Your vocals will also be routed through the patch, and processed in up to 2 different types of effects (tuning, EQ) should you desire these.
  - The patch is triggered using a central cueing system, which revolves around the setlist.txt text file in the patch. Your individual track sections should be renamed from what I have named mine (for example, r YOUGOTIT), and should instead have a different, case sensitive, all-one-word name which represents each track (usually being the track name but in all caps with 0 spaces).
  - Your visuals and audio are triggered in the same sections, allowing you to turn them on and off simultaneously. When the audio finishes, it turns the visuals off too and triggers the next track in the setlist.
  - The interlude is a manually controlled section where you can take as long or as short as you need, with a video loop of your choice playing in the background (and potentially an interlude track too)
  - You can use any MIDI information or keybind to trigger the next cue from within the interlude, but you just need to adjust which midi information or keybind the software is looking for in the section about triggering the cues. Currently, it is set to take midi control 127 value (sustain pedal pressed) or keyboard spacebar pressed.
  - There are a few different visual interactions in the patch, some using brightness and peakamp~ to create sound reactive visuals, some using a file drop to attach tons of videos, which it will cycle between when triggered by the audio, and some are plain and straightforward. Copy and use as many of each as you deem fit for each track of yours.
  - Ensure you correctly save the preset snapshots for the plug-ins (and feel free to use your own plugins, the ones I have used and the type of plugins used are merely recommendation and guidance but do not have to be used if you do not desire.

I hope you have as much fun creating performances with this patch as I did making this patch, remember the goal of the patch is to take the weight off of the curation of audiovisual concert experiences, allowing you to focus on the artistic aesthetic by just placing all of your content and ideas into this patch and letting them do their thing!

Have fun,

Andrew McCabe, 33732385
