# WELCOME-TO-THE-FORGOTTEN
Andrew McCabe - 33732385 - The performance patch created as part of my final EMCT project

Welcome to my performance patch, created with smaller artists in mind, for them to have an easier time in setting up and operating performances through an inexpensive, easy-to-use software that does it all!

In order for the patch to work for you as a different artist, you must first understand the concept of the software:
  - currrently, the software - once downloaded - will take you into a smaller version of my original setlist that I performed and tested this patch with. This setlist is a template / example of how you can use the patch for your own use case.
  - The patch itself is designed for you to load your backing tracks and visual elements into each section of the patch, to be triggered and modified by the patch as you perform.
  - Your vocals will also be routed through the patch, and processed in up to 2 different types of effects (tuning, EQ) should you desire these.
  - The patch is triggered using a central cueing system, which revolves around the setlist.txt text file in the patch. Your individual track sections should be renamed from what I have named mine (for example, r YOUGOTIT), and should instead have a different, case sensitive, all-one-word name which represents each track (usually being the track name but in all caps with 0 spaces).
